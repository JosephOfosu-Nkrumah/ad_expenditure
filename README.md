# ad_expenditure
A scatter plot on a company's advertisement budget and sales.The graph represents a positive correlation indicating that the connection between the advertising budget and sales is clear. Therefore, a concrete fact which can be established is that a large advertising budget is more likely to go a long way to achieving higher sales quota. Also, the more spent on advertising, the wider number of people is reached. Hence there is an increase in the potential customer's pool.
A $50,000 increase in ads would translate into approximately 2500 additional units sold. Similarly, a $100,000 increase in ads would translate into approximately 5000 additional units sold.
